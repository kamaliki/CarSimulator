== How to control GUI? ==

GUI is til experimental and unfinished, but there are some keys you
can use:

- SPACE		one step
- P			toggle between auto-step and manual stepping
- Q			stop simulation and exit windows
- Left/right arrow
            when user press one of this arrows, the hint is
            saved in agent's perception and agent can read
            this hint (and act based on it).

== What should containt configuration file? ==

Config file should contain these constants. For core functions of simulator:
left-lane-speed				integer
center-lane-speed			integer
right-lane-speed			integer

left-lane-gap				integer
center-lane-gap				integer
right-lane-gap				integer

agent-initial-position		integer
agent-speed					integer
agent						string

And for GUI:

auto-step					boolean
auto-step-delay 			integer (in ms)

Look into example config file in tests/simulator.conf for example and more
info about every constant.

== What is gap, car, agent, or lane? ==
